SBA: Paycheck Protection Program data analysis

The SBA introduced PPP to keep the workforce employed by providing businesses with
uncollateralized, low-interest loans. But how this money was allocated and what types of
businesses were actually benefited from the program remains the question, as many
applications were removed from the application datasets without explanation. For our project,
we analyzed 2 datasets containing information on approved and rejected loans of businesses
from the state of Georgia. Our aim was to figure out whether there are any regional,
economical, demographical, and political factors that affect the approval of the loan
applications and whether there is any possibility of redlining. Our initial finding indicated
that the majority of the removed applications come from congressional districts with a
specific political affiliation and primarily were from areas of low income. To dig deep into
our findings, we selected variables to identify the characteristics of the removed applications
and what differs from the approved ones. Our preliminary analysis indicates that the number
of jobs retained, Lender organization, Congressional district, Racial Demography, and Type
of Business are influencing factors and may affect the allocation and approval of loans.
Models like regression and decision trees will help to classify the influential factors behind an
application's acceptance/removal and to predict whether or not a loan will be removed from
the application dataset.
